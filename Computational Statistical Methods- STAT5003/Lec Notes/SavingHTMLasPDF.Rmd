# install pagedown if needed
if (!requireNamespace("pagedown", quietly = TRUE)) install.packages("pagedown")

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
# List all Week HTML files
html_files <- list.files(pattern = "^Week_\\d+.*\\.html$")

# Convert each one to PDF using Chrome
for (f in html_files) {
  pdf_name <- sub("\\.html$", ".pdf", f)
  message("Converting ", f, " → ", pdf_name)
  pagedown::chrome_print(input = f, output = pdf_name)
}

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
