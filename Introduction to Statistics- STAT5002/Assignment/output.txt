========== Q2: Caffeine Effect ==========

Q2(a): Hypotheses
-------------------------------------------
Let mu_d = population mean difference (PRE - POST)
H0: mu_d = 0 (caffeine has no effect)
H1: mu_d > 0 (caffeine reduces reaction time)

Q2(b): Test selection
-------------------------------------------
Test: Paired t-test (one-sided, right-tailed)
Justification:
- Same athletes measured twice (paired design)
- Testing if caffeine REDUCES reaction time (one-sided)
- Small sample size (n=16), assume normality

Q2(c): Assumption checking
-------------------------------------------
Differences (PRE - POST): 11 7 6 8 8 -2 7 9 6 6 5 2 7 -2 6 1 
Mean difference: 5.3125 
SD of differences: 3.718759 

Shapiro-Wilk test for normality:
W = 0.8876777 , p-value = 0.05119248 
Conclusion: No evidence against normality (p > 0.05)

Q2(d): Test statistic and p-value
-------------------------------------------
Sample size n = 16 
Mean difference = 5.3125 
SD of differences = 3.718759 
SE of differences = 0.9296897

Rejection region: t > 1.75305 

Q2(e): Conclusion
-------------------------------------------
p-value = 0 < 0.05
Decision: Reject H0
Conclusion: There is statistically significant evidence that
the caffeine gel reduces reaction time at the 5% significance level.

Bootstrap p-value >= 0.05
Decision: Fail to reject H0
Conclusion: The bootstrap simulation suggests insufficient evidence
that caffeine reduces reaction time at the 5% significance level.

========== Q3: Caffeine Effect and Self-report ==========

HATPC Framework for Two-Sample t-test
=======================================

H - HYPOTHESES:
Let mu_A = population mean caffeine effect for alert group
Let mu_NA = population mean caffeine effect for not-alert group
H0: mu_A = mu_NA (no difference in caffeine effect)
H1: mu_A != mu_NA (caffeine effect differs between groups)

A - ASSUMPTIONS:
1. Both samples are independent random samples
2. Differences in each group are normally distributed
3. Equal variances (we'll use Welch's t-test for robustness)

Alert group differences: 11 7 8 8 7 9 6 5 7 6 
Not-alert group differences: 6 -2 6 2 -2 1 

Summary statistics:
Alert group: n = 10 , mean = 7.4 , SD = 1.712698 
Not-alert group: n = 6 , mean = 1.833333 , SD = 3.600926 

T - TEST STATISTIC:
Pooled SD = 2.552776 
SE (pooled) = 1.318248 
t-statistic = 4.222777 
Degrees of freedom = 14 

P - P-VALUE:
p-value (two-sided) = 0.00085199 
Significance level alpha = 0.05

C - CONCLUSION:
Critical value (two-sided, alpha=0.05) = +/- 2.144787 
Rejection region: |t| > 2.144787 

Decision: Reject H0 (p = 9e-04 < 0.05)
Conclusion: There is statistically significant evidence that
the caffeine effect differs between athletes who felt alert
and those who did not feel alert at the 5% significance level.

Verification with t.test():

========== Q4: Advertising and Sales ==========

Q4(a): Linear regression model
-------------------------------------------

Call:
lm(formula = y ~ x)

Residuals:
     Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max 
-11.7304  -3.7440   0.7107   3.9750   5.9593 

Coefficients:
            Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|)    
(Intercept)  19.9510     2.5545   7.810 3.45e-07 ***
x             1.8991     0.1944   9.771 1.27e-08 ***
---
Signif. codes:  0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1

Residual standard error: 5.119 on 18 degrees of freedom
Multiple R-squared:  0.8414,	Adjusted R-squared:  0.8326 
F-statistic: 95.47 on 1 and 18 DF,  p-value: 1.274e-08



Interpretation of coefficients:
Intercept (beta_0) = 19.95 thousand cups
Interpretation: When advertising budget is $0, the predicted sales are
approximately 19.95 thousand cups ( 19951 cups).

Slope (beta_1) = 1.9 thousand cups per thousand dollars
Interpretation: For each additional $1,000 spent on advertising,
the predicted sales increase by approximately 1.9 thousand cups ( 1899 cups).
Equivalently: For each additional $1 spent, sales increase by about 1.9 cups.

Formal assumption tests:

1. NORMALITY OF RESIDUALS:
Shapiro-Wilk test: W = 0.9273455 , p-value = 0.1372667 
Conclusion: No evidence against normality (p > 0.05)
The normality assumption appears to be satisfied.

2. LINEARITY:
Visual inspection of:
- Scatterplot shows a general linear trend initially, but appears to
  flatten or decline at higher advertising budgets (potential non-linearity)
- Residuals vs Fitted plot should show random scatter around zero
  If there's a pattern (curve), linearity is violated

3. HOMOSCEDASTICITY (constant variance):
Visual inspection of:
- Residuals vs Fitted: spread should be roughly constant
- Scale-Location plot: should show horizontal trend

Correlation between x and y: 0.9173 
R-squared: 0.8414 

Q4(c): Other variables that could affect sales
-------------------------------------------
Two other variables that could affect weekly coffee sales:

1. WEATHER/TEMPERATURE:
   - Coffee consumption typically increases in colder weather
   - Seasonal variations affect customer behavior
   - Could measure: average weekly temperature or weather conditions

2. DAY OF WEEK / HOLIDAYS:
   - Weekdays vs weekends may have different sales patterns
   - Public holidays, exam periods, or special events affect foot traffic
   - Could measure: number of weekdays/weekend days, or holiday indicator

Additional possibilities:
- Competitor promotions or pricing
- Store location foot traffic
- Product launches or menu changes
- Economic indicators (consumer confidence, employment)
