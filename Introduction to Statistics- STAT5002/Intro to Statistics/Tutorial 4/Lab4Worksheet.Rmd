# Linear regression

## Import data

In this workshop, we will use simulated climate data based on real data from the Bureau of Meteorology at Canterbury Racecourse AWS {station 066194} collected in 2023. The simulated data contains several different daily measurements throughout Autumn (March-May).

We will use the following variables.

  * `X3pm.temperature` (**daily temperature measured at 3 pm**)
  * `Maximum.temperature` (**maximum daily temperature**)
  * `X9am.temperature` (**daily temperature measured at 9 am**)
  * `Minimum.temperature` (**minimum daily temperature**) 
  
The temperature data are measured in Celsius. Please beware that the variable names are **case sensitive**.

**`Task 1:`** Download the data file `AutumnCleaned.csv` in your `data` folder within your `STAT5002` folder. Then **import** the csv file into a variable called `data`:

```{r}
### write your code here. 
```

**`Task 2:`** How many observations are there? How many variables are there?

## Scatter plot
    
Generate a scatter plot for the the daily temperature observed at 3 pm (`X3pm.temperature`) and the observed daily maximum temperature (`Maximum.temperature`), with `X3pm.temperature` ($X$) on the horizontal axis and `Maximum.temperature` ($Y$) on the vertical axis.
    
Generate another scatter plot for the daily temperature observed at 9 am (`X9am.temperature`) and the observed daily minimum temperature (`Minimum.temperature`), with `X9am.temperature` ($X$) on the horizontal axis and `Minimum.temperature` ($Y$) on the vertical axis.

**Comment on and compare these associations based on the scatter plot.** 
    
```{r}
### Write your code here
###
```

## Linear model

Using the function `lm()` to build a linear model for predicting daily maximum temperature (`Maximum.temperature`) given the temperature observed at 3 pm (`X3pm.temperature`). 

Generate a scatter plot for `X3pm.temperature` and `Maximum.temperature`. 

Plot the resulting regression line on top of the scatter plot using `abline()`. 

Predict the value of daily maximum temperature given a value of $X=33$ for the temperature observed at 3 pm. 

Use the function `points(X, Y, col="red", cex=3, pch=19)` to plot the predict value $Y$ (together with the predictor $X$), where the options `col="red", cex=3, pch=19` specify the color, the marker size, and the mark type, respectively. 

```{R}
### Write your code here
```

## Residual plot

Generate the residual plot of the linear model built above. Comment on if the regression line is a good fit. 

```{R}
### Write your code here
```


## Coefficient of determination

Compared to the baseline prediction, what percentage of variation in the response variable `Maximum.temperature` can be explained by the linear regression model fitted above. 

```{R}
### Write your code here
```


## Verification of the coefficient of determination

Recall that the coefficient of determination of the regression line is
\[
1 - \frac{\text{SSE}}{\text{SST}}, \quad \text{SSE} = \sum_{i = 1}^n (y_i - a - b x_i)^2, \quad \text{SST} = \sum_{i = 1}^n (y_i - \bar{y})^2
\]
where $a$ and $b$ are the intercept and the slope of the regression line, respectively. We want to verify that the coefficient of determination can be indeed be written as squared correlation coefficient ($r^2$) in R.

**`Task 1:`** Compute the sum of squared residuals/errors (SSE) of the fitted linear model and the total sum of squares of the dependent variable `X3pm.temperature`. 


```{r}
### Write your code here
```

**`Task 2:`** Compute the coefficient of determination using the above formula, and compare it with $r^2$, do they agree? 

```{r}
### Write your code here
```

## Additional tasks (on your own time)

You can also build the linear model for the pair of variables `Minimum.temperature` and `X9am.temperature`, and then check the quality of fit using the residual plot and the coefficient of determination.

# Simulating chance

In an experiment, three fair dice are thrown independently. What is the chance of getting a total equal to 6? 

Write R code to simulate 1000 experiments and report your result. 

You should compare your result with other students or repeat your experiments with different random seeds, what do you observe?
